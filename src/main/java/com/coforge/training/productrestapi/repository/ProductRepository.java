 JPA Repository is mainly used for managing the data in a Spring Boot Application. 
 * JpaRepository is particularly a JPA specific extension for Repository.
 * Jpa Repository contains the APIs for basic CRUD operations, the APIS for 
 * pagination, and the APIs for sorting.
 * This Layer interacts with Database

	 * contains the lowercase input name with wildcards. % - Any no. of characters, _ - Single character
	 * @Param("name") is used to bind the name parameter from the 
	 * method signature to the :name placeholder in the query
